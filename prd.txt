4. Problem / Pain Section

Background: light grey panel (#F3F4F6).

Title:
If You’re Already Running Ads or Getting Leads, This Is Probably You 👇

Short paragraph:
Most businesses don’t need yet another tool. They need their existing marketing to stop leaking. If any of this sounds familiar, you’re not alone:

Bullets:
	•	You pay for clicks, but very few become real conversations.
	•	You get “leads”, but most never reply after the first message.
	•	Your team is busy, so follow-up is random and inconsistent.
	•	You know AI is powerful, but you don’t know where to plug it in.
	•	You’ve worked with agencies before and got more reports than revenue.

Bridge sentence:
We fix this by treating your business like a funnel, not a collection of disconnected assets — and then we plug AI into the parts that matter most.

14. FAQ Section

Title:
Questions You Might Have

Q1: Do you just use ChatGPT and charge me on top?
A1:
We use AI tools, yes — but the value is in how we design your funnel, offers, follow-up and automations based on your numbers and customers. Tools are cheap. Good systems are not.

Q2: Do I need to change my entire tech stack?
A2:
No. We start with what you already use (website, email platform, WhatsApp, CRM if any). If we recommend a new tool, it will be simple, affordable and clearly justified.

Q3: How long before I see results?
A3:
Most clients start seeing changes in lead quality and response rates within 2–4 weeks of implementation, depending on traffic volume and how quickly we can launch your funnel changes.

Q4: What if this doesn’t work for me?
A4:
On the AI Revenue Call and in the AI Revenue Blueprint, we’ll be honest about what’s realistic. If we don’t think we can make a meaningful difference, we won’t recommend a project.

Q5: Are you a long-term agency?
A5:
We work more like a special forces team: come in, fix the critical parts, set up systems and either stay on for light optimisation or hand over cleanly to your team.
